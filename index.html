    <h2>Personal Information and Interest in IT</h2>
    <img src="me.png" alt="picture of me" height="474" width="270">
    <p>That’s me on the right. I started studying IT this year after transferring from Law which I transferred to from science. I am of Greek descent with all my grandparents being born in Greece; however, both my parents as well as my siblings and I were born here. I graduated Year 12 in 2019 and since then have been attempting to find a degree that suits me. Much to my extended family’s disappointment I only speak English. In my free time I enjoy skateboarding and playing games. My favourite video game of all time is Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory for reasons I should not have to explain.</p>
    <p>My interest in IT began from a very young age, I remember an old IBM PC that my dad had set up for my sisters and I that I would spend hours on playing 3d pinball and other small games. From then on, I have developed a love for computers, particularly developing interest in networks, security and the internet from films and shows such as The Matrix, Mr. Robot, and particular YouTube channels focusing on the dark web and other internet mysteries.</p>
    <p>My father was the largest factor in sparking my interest in IT, as he has been working in IT his entire life. After that aforementioned IBM PC became beyond obsolete, he gave me an old Toshiba Satellite laptop loaded with half a gigabyte of RAM and an Intel Pentium 4, which I used up until about 2010 to play everything except Minecraft, which it was far too underpowered for. In early 2020 I finally could afford to build my own gaming PC, which I had been eyeing off for years. From here my interest in IT boomed even further, and I have been obsessed with technology and computers ever since</p>
    <p>I decided to come to RMIT to study IT largely for its location and the research I had done surrounding the IT course here. It provided a fresh start for me and a change of scenery transferring from Deakin to RMIT. I am also quite fascinated with the history and heritage of RMIT and the city that it surrounds, as I am quite the history nerd.</p>
    <p>During my studies at RMIT I expect to learn everything needed to succeed in the field of IT, particularly in the field of networking and cybersecurity which I have a particular interest in. I would however still like to be well-versed in programming, web development and other skills in order to allow me to explore all my options in the field if I were to ever change my mind on my field of choice.</p>
