<h3>Myer-Briggs Results</h3> </a>
<p>My Myer-Briggs results show that my personality type is INTP-T, also referred to as the Logician. This states that I am more introverted than extroverted, more intuitive than observant, more rational than emotional, far more prospecting than judging and much more turbulent than assertive. This result is extremely accurate as I am often fairly inquisitive and find myself not only questioning everything but often thinking too much and unable to shut off my brain.</p>

<h3>Learning Style Assessment Results</h3> </a>
<p>The results of my learning style assessment state that my learning style is visual. This implies that in order for me to learn and remember well, a visual aid of some kind usually assists greatly. I find this fairly accurate as I often tend to forget what someone has said to me but I will remember things that I have seen in much greater detail.</p>

<h3>Career Personality Test Results</h3> </a>
<p>The final test I chose to take was a Career Personality Test. The results of this show that my work style is largely humanitarian and innovator. This means that my work has to have a positive outcome on people, and be beneficial and insightful. It also highlights my enjoyment of complex issues and analyitical problem solving.</p>
<p>When working in a group, in order to optimally complete tasks, an organised document outlining every goal that is needed to be completed would provide beneficial support to myself in understanding what I must do next to complete the task. Along with this, discussion of ideas in depth would allow me to have a greater understanding of what each team members goal and idea was, as well as what is required for them to accomplish these tasks as I like to have the answers to questions such as that. </p>
